A few years ago I found a site/service called [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) that provides a terminal friendly weather report based on your location, or a location that you provide. For years, I had wanted to replicate this type of project for a simple view of the upcoming professional sports schedule, given a city. About a month ago I had a separate idea that I wanted to make an express app to play around with it after using it to make my team's technical interview test at work. Then after brainstorming ideas for express apps I remembered the sport schedule idea I had wanted to do years ago.
