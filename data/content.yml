      duration: '2021-Current'
      content: As a Senior Engineer, my responsibilities have been slightly shifted to a higher level scope. I am still in the weeds with developing base components, but I am also spending time ideating our design system, planning a CMS integration, mentoring team members, and doing code reviews.

      company: Author By Humana
      duration: '2020-2021'

      company: 2Is inc.
      duration: '2018'

      company: Getfused
      duration: '2017'

      url: https://sprt.dev
      description: This is a terminal friendly way to see the upcoming games for my favorite pro sports teams. I got this idea from [wttr.in](https://wttr.in), a terminal friendly service for viewing the weather. I loved having the weather quickly and easily, without ads, so I made myself a web app to replicate that experience for sports schedules. If you are curious to read the instructions for how to use sprt.dev or poke through [the source code](https://github.com/tylerjlawson/sprt.dev). If you'd like to read more in depth about how I made sprt.dev [go here](/blog/sprt-dot-dev).

    - name: Author by Humana
      image: 'images/portfolio/author.png'
      url: https://authorbyhumana.com
      description: I joined the Author team in May 2020, just after finishing my college finals. Our sites are developed with a member centric approach. My role in the months leading up to the launch consisted of developing the majority of our base components that are shared between our two sites in a React-based node package. Our public facing site uses React Gatsby, a static site generator. And on the member portal side we use React with create-react-app.

    - name: Nikki-O crochet
      image: 'images/portfolio/nikkio.png'
      description: A friend of mine wanted to get off Etsy and onto her own website to sell her crochet work. I made her a site using Hugo, a custom theme, Snipcart, Github Actions, and Forestry. This was the first time I had worked with a marketplace SaaS and it was a fun learning experience.

    - name: Creative Business Design v2
      image: 'images/portfolio/cbd-v2.png'
      url: https://cbdcompanies.com
      description: CBD is my dad's company. When he wanted a new site to better fit his business needs, I used Hugo, Github (with Github Actions), and Forestry to make the current site. After making this site I fell in love with this tech stack for free sites with a CMS, so I wrote [this medium article](https://medium.com/@tylerjlawson2/best-tech-stack-for-small-static-sites-7b6e64eff3c1).

    - name: My First Portfolio
      image: 'images/portfolio/oldPortfolio.png'
      description: I made my first portfolio using mostly just SCSS and HTML. I wanted to gain experience making my own components and also wanted to keep the project relatively lightweight. If you'd like to see the code here is the [Github repo](https://github.com/tylerjlawson/portfolio-v1)

    - name: The PLPT
      image: 'images/portfolio/plpt.png'
      url: https://thepulpit.github.io
      description: I made this site in 2017 when a friend of mine expressed interest in making his first blog. After seeing some buzz about static site generators, I decided to checkout [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I made mostly a custom theme and launched my first website using a static site generator.

    - name: Visiting Dental Hygiene
      image: 'images/portfolio/vdha.png'
      url: https://visitingdentalhygiene.com/
      description: This site was first made using a wordpress template in 2017 and was redone in 2019 to use [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/). I was particularly excited to test out this framework. For small sites, it is lightweight and easy to use. You can see the [project repo here](https://github.com/visitingdentalhygiene/VDHAWebsite).

    - name: Creative Business Design V1
      image: 'images/portfolio/cbd.png'
      description: Creative Business design was the final site that I did during my time at Getfused as an Intern. This site is no longer live, but it was a great early experience with CSS.

    - name: Wynn Casino
      image: 'images/portfolio/wynn.png'

    - name: Private Client Underwriters
      image: 'images/portfolio/privateClientU.png'
      url: https://www.privateclientu.com/
      description: This was the first site I ever styled and worked on. This was done during my first month at Getfused. I was given a mockup from a Photoshop file and delivered the finished site by styling the site mostly from scratch.
